Explanation:
Why Split Components into Their Own Server?
Separating components into individual servers improves scalability, fault isolation, and resource allocation. It allows for better management, security, and performance optimization of each component.

Why Use a Load Balancer (HAProxy) Cluster?

High Availability: Configuring HAProxy as a cluster provides redundancy and fault tolerance. If one load balancer fails, the other one takes over, ensuring continuous service availability.

Load Distribution: HAProxy distributes incoming requests across multiple servers, optimizing resource utilization and improving performance.

Why Separate Web Server and Application Server?


Nginx (Web Server): Designed to serve static content efficiently and handle incoming HTTP requests. Separating it from the application server allows for better performance and resource utilization.
Application Server: Handles dynamic content generation, executing server-side scripts, and interacting with the database. Separating it allows for better scalability and management of application-specific tasks.

Conclusion:

Splitting components into separate servers and using a load balancer cluster enhances the scalability, fault tolerance, and performance of the infrastructure. It allows for better resource allocation, security, and management of each component, ensuring a robust and efficient web hosting environment
